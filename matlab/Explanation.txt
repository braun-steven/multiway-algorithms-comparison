Original EEM files: these are excitation emission matrices (EEMs) showing fluorescence intensity as a function of wavelength. 
We have blank subtracted these results (water blank) and normalised to the intensity of the Water Raman peak. 

Matlab outputs: show the EEMs of the PARAFAC modelled components.

Matlab script: the script looks for the EEMs folder in the same parent folder and should run ok (fingers crossed).
